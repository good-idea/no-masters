## No Masters

A simple command line script that will rename your "master" branch to "main", and optionally:

- Delete the local `master` branch
- Update the origin's default branch to `main`
- Delete the origin's `master` branch

## Usage

`npx no-masters`

### Caveats

- Your remote must be named `origin`
- Updating the origin only works with Github and requires [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/manual/installation) to be installed
